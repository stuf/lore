# Memories of Childhood

Cappy didn't really have a happy childhood. Happy memories, sure, but they were constantly overshadowed by the unpredictable nature of her parents.

Her parents would often fight or argue and it would leave her feeling scared and confused. "Everybody was having fun just minutes earlier" she'd think, trying to make sense of what could have happened.

She would increasingly start being on edge all the time, because the lack of any consistent thing that would end up turning a good moment into a nightmare. Well, maybe not consistent, because the only thing that was consistent was the anger and disappointment that ensued, when she'd make a mistake or misunderstand something.

Getting angry or upset would be met sometimes with physical force, but always resulting in her being sent to think about what she had done. During those times by herself, she would find herself being confused and couldn't understand what she felt. The end result would always be the same; she was at fault for whatever it was that led up to this.

Sure, sometimes it may have had a reason, but more often than not, she would react and be punished for it. Over time, caution would grow and she would end up bottling it up, and it worked—until it didn't. She would swallow her pride and self-worth for the sake of reality being bearable for a moment. It would sooner or later end up worse, however, because like a bottle, you can fill it up only so much until it flows over.

In those moments, all of the feelings she would have kept to herself, would end up pouring out. Like a tsunami of all emotions, all at once, Cappy is easily overwhelmed and doesn't know what to do. She would end up crying, screaming, kicking, flailing—at anything or anyone—it didn't matter where or when. Of course, if she was at home, she would get slapped in the face—feeling extremely humiliated—and then being sent to her room, now feeling mentally drained, completely ashamed and all alone.

How could she even begin to rationalize what just happened? She was clearly at fault. _She_ was clearly the one who started all of it. She could not understand, because afterwards she could think clear as day what she did and said.

This would become a cycle that would plague her for years, even after she moved out, albeit less severely.
